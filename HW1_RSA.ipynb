Please refer to the uploaded manual `AI_Tools_Guidelines` for recommended ways how to use AI to advance your studies in a way that supports your learning. That means that you should not be satisfied if an AI tool hands you a working version of your code, but that you should put in effort to understand how exactly the problem is solved. Another note of caution: What might work for large programming languages like Python, does not necessarily work for Stan. Check your code carefully and do NOT blindly trust AI.*"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "During the past weeks, you have learned how Bayesian inference works and how it can be used in Bayesian cognitive models. You also learned about a specific type of Bayesian models that can be used to model pragmatic language understanding and production, the Rational Speech Act models. The goal of this homework assignment is for you to learn how to implement Bayesian models in Stan and, specifically, how to implement RSA models in Stan. A special focus will be on the different use cases and evaluation methods of RSA models."

    "The purpose of the following model is to explain the use of overinformative referring expressions in pragmatic communication. In referential communication, the speaker’s task is to produce a referring expression that allows a listener to identify the target in the context. Consider the context below, where the target is the small blue pin. A referring expression including a size adjective (the small pin) is strictly speaking sufficient for uniquely establishing reference to the target, yet speakers often “overmodify” with color, producing referring expressions like the small blue pin. This overmodification phenomenon is what the model is intended to capture.\n",
