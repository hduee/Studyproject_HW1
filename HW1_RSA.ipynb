Please refer to the uploaded manual `AI_Tools_Guidelines` for recommended ways how to use AI to advance your studies in a way that supports your learning. That means that you should not be satisfied if an AI tool hands you a working version of your code, but that you should put in effort to understand how exactly the problem is solved. Another note of caution: What might work for large programming languages like Python, does not necessarily work for Stan. Check your code carefully and do NOT blindly trust AI.*"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "During the past weeks, you have learned how Bayesian inference works and how it can be used in Bayesian cognitive models. You also learned about a specific type of Bayesian models that can be used to model pragmatic language understanding and production, the Rational Speech Act models. The goal of this homework assignment is for you to learn how to implement Bayesian models in Stan and, specifically, how to implement RSA models in Stan. A special focus will be on the different use cases and evaluation methods of RSA models."

    "- The data block defines the observed data: we have N trials, and for each trial we know the semantic similarity, the phonological similarity, and the response time.\n",
    "- In the transformed data block, the response times are log-transformed, so the model works on log_rt. This makes the normality assumption more reasonable, because raw response times are positive and often skewed.\n",
    "- In the parameters block, the model estimates:\n",
    "    - alpha (intercept),\n",
    "    - beta_sem (effect of semantic similarity),\n",
    "    - beta_phon (effect of phonological similarity),\n",
    "    - sigma_rt (residual standard deviation, constrained to be positive).\n",
    "    - Each of these parameters has a weakly informative normal prior.\n",
    "- In the model block, each log_rt[i] is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean alpha + beta_sem * semantic_similarity[i] + beta_phon * phonological_similarity[i] and standard deviation sigma_rt. So the two similarity measures linearly predict log response time.\n",
    "- In the generated quantities block:\n",
    "    - log_likelihood[i] stores the pointwise log density for each trial,\n",
    "    - log_rt_ppd[i] stores posterior-predictive draws on the log scale,\n",
    "    - rt_ppd[i] exponentiates those draws back to the original time scale, giving predicted response times for posterior predictive checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, it’s a Bayesian linear regression model that predicts how fast someone responds based on how semantically and phonologically related the word and context are.\n",

    "    - estimate how much semantic and phonological similarity speed up or slow down retrieval,\n",
    "    - quantify priming effects at the level of participants or conditions,\n",
    "    - generate posterior predictive RT distributions for new items or contexts,\n",
    "    - compare hypotheses (e.g., “semantic effects are stronger than phonological effects”) using the posterior over the beta coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3) At which level of analysis does it model this cognitive capacity and why? (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Stan model is a computational model in Marr’s framework. It specifies what mapping the cognitive system implements: given inputs (semantic similarity and phonological similarity), it defines a probability distribution over response times.\n",
    "- The code does not specify an algorithm or representation format for lexical access (no activation dynamics, no specific retrieval steps, no architecture), so it is not an algorithmic-level model. And it does not mention neural structures or hardware, so it is not an implementational-level model either. It remains at the abstract, probabilistic computational-level description of the capacity “map semantic/phonological similarity to response-time distributions.”\n",

Consider the context below, where the target is the small blue pin. A referring expression including a size adjective (the small pin) is strictly speaking sufficient for uniquely establishing reference to the target, yet speakers often “overmodify” with color, producing referring expressions like the small blue pin.
